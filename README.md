# Binary Analysis

A toolkit of code and binaries for the purpose of investigation, teaching and analysis.

Simple programs are written to demonstrate aspects of language, compilation and operating systems. This code is compiled
across a wide range of compilers and operating systems. The result is curated into the binary analysis toolkit.

## Usage Scenarios

This project might be useful if you are:

  * An exploit developer or vulnerability researcher
  * Teaching simple programming concepts
  * Reverse engineering simple binaries
  * Understanding and becoming familiar with differences in compilation
